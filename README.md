**Award-winning** Cambridge Computer Science Part II (3rd Year) Dissertation. 

An _automatically-parallelising_ compiler written in OCaml: compiling a user-annotated subset of sequential Go code into multithreaded Go code. 

Utilises a mixture of _effect tracking_ and _cost analysis_. Cost analysis is a mixture of _static_ and _dynamic_ analysis which allows us to estimate both data structure sizes and execution-time estimates for programs.
