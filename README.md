# Automatic Parallelisation using Effect Tracking and Cost Analysis 

**Award-winning**. Awarded the CST Department Prize for a Highly Commended Dissertation (Part II) in the Computer Science Tripos for Part II 2023. 

An _automatic-parallelisation_ compiler written in OCaml: compiling a user-annotated subset of sequential Go code into multithreaded Go code. 

Utilises a mixture of _effect tracking_ and _cost analysis_. Cost analysis combines _static_ and _dynamic_ analysis, which allows us to estimate both data-structure sizes and execution-times for programs.
